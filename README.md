# Summer Fest Grind!
Hi everyone

This is a simple macro to help grind beach balls during the Adopt Me Summer fest. It is based off of Natro Grindhouse, so it assumes you have your setup like that in terms of resolution, scaling, etc... The house setup doesn't matter since it doesn't spend  any time in the house.

This works with multi-accounts with RAM, but assumes you are using the Trayconizer setup (I recommend SmartSystemMenu more) where only Roblox windows appear in the alt-tab and NOTHING else. 

There is no startup assistant in this, so you must make sure all your accounts are logged in and all the various startup windows in adopt me are closed. After that the macro will handle teleporting to the minigame

Just download the summerfestgrind.ahk file and run it, press F3 to terminate it at any time.

# What does it do?

The minigame countdown asking if you want to teleport begins at specific times, basically 2 minutes and 15 seconds into every adopt me day which is 10 minutes long. When the macro sees it is time, it begins cycling through the roblox windows clicking YES to teleport. This not only keeps the session alive and prevent 20 min timeout, but also resets your character in the minigame circle as sometimes with a lot of players you can get bumped out occasionally.

Pressing 'nice' at the end of the minigame isn't necessary, you get the beachballs and the macro will still be able to click teleport next time it comes up

Since you only have 45 seconds of the teleport window, if you use a lot of accounts it may not be able to switch to all of them in time. However, it will pick up with whatever accounts it didn't get to in the next 45 second window

# How many beachballs can i get?

If nobody gets any beach balls, everyone gets first place and 1650 beach balls. But if you have a lot of accounts, some might get 1 acutalaly if it is close and they get bumped around. In that case, some might get 1500 for 2nd place. So assuming 1500 for conservative estimate, that is 216,000 beach balls per day!
